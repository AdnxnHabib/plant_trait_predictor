# Overview 

In this study, we explore the integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and XGBoost to predict plant traits from a combination of citizen science plant photographs and ancillary environmental data. Preliminary results indicate that this hybrid model can achieve competitive performance, with an average RÂ² score of 0.50 on the training set. However, the test set performance of 0.26 suggests room for improvement, prompting further investigation into advanced feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model optimization techniques.
